Donald Guy's Conference Field-notes
=====================

Largely unedited text and photo-scan-ed notes from (Tech) conferences

While I have not deliberately misconstrued anything, what is recorded
is not guaranteed to be an accurate reflection of what was said or presented.
Notes are taken on the fly and revised (if at all) minimally for coherence and
to add metadata.

I'll likely spellcheck some, but miss some errors as well.
Nothing is guaranteed to be complete, well-structured, or spelled right.

Hand-written notes may not even be legible.

Level of detail not reflective of quality of talk or level of interest. These
things can have effects, but so too can both my and my laptop's energy levels
as well as numerous environmental factors.

Enjoy, such as they are :grin:
