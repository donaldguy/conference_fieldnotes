## Driving Change @strife25
 - 2011 he joined IBM, started investigating devops
 - How do you change a massive culture? rich history and huge numbers
 - Start small - become the experts first so you could come from a place of experience
 - Code talks louder than words; prototypes show feasibility
 - Market your results, tell anyone who would listen
 - DevOps has a great story - good for everyone
 - Videos work great for marketing
 - Early adopters, get them
 - Mentor others, find new contributers to the cause
 - Know your audience; some people do not care what other companies do
 - Testers don't care about how fast devs can move
 - Be the visionary; don't be afraid to inspire; Award people for their small achievements
 - Takes discipline - be a constructive nagger, lead by example

## maximize your terminal's information density
Chris Earway, Phd appneta cce@appneta

- Browser vs Terminal - the 2 ways we interact with computer
- Browsers are graphical and connectionaless and general purpose
- Terminals are powerful but of relatively limited use cases
- Browsers we use tabs and sessions
- We preserve our browser sessiosn, but not our terminal sessions?
- tmux is great - the iTerm integration is great
- prefer high information density in the browser
- multitail lets you tail lots of files at once
- less -S to prevent wrap
 - pv -l for rate of grep matching , density in logs
 - multicommand watch for adhoc dashboards

## 17th Century Shipbuilding and your failed software project
a.k.a. why your project management sucks
@petecheslock

- the fassa was one of the greatest ships built. 1628 most expensive
- sank after less than 1 mile of travel
- was salvadged many years later, lessons learned
- ship sank cause it was unstable
- ship was extended in size at last minute, twice, including doing things that none of the shipbuilders had ever done
- rush job on guns that they would likely have failed anyway
- king demanded ship be outfited with lots of carvings - raised center of gravity
- shipwright became ill and died in middle of project - was not documented
- lurch test failed. but adding ballast would lower gun ports below water; also no one told the shipbuilders it failed

## Commanders, Communications, Contexts, and Convoys
@gwaldo

12 lessons about leadership learned from the marine corps

1. Mission Accomplishment
2. Troop Welfare

When the job is finished, Take Care of your People

Gratitude and Rewards
 - gratitude is the easiest reward you can give, and one of the most overlooked

There will be bad days
 - keep them in perspective

"Sweating now so you don't Bleed Later" - run drills.

Details Matter

Clear and Concise Communication - say it well so you don't have to say it again

Encourage Initiative - grow your people.

Commander's Intent - know where jobs fit in the scope of the whole; i.e. Context

Failure is a Team Event

Humility != Timidity

Have a Confidant - someone you can be candid with.

Camaraderie
